3D experimental trajectory analysis

1. Use file 'Alltrajdata.m' along with dataset 'CTRL1_trim.mat' to load and clean up cell tracking data to obtain 
positions and velocities at each time step for each cell in spheroid 1. Repeat for 2 and 3 if required.
Alternatively use the provided datasets 'Alltrajdata1.m' etc.

2. Use file 'fullanalysis3D_exp.m' to carry out analysis of the cell tracks as in Figure 5 of the paper. This file can:
-plot trajectories
-plot the RMSS time series; estimate average cell speed parameter S with confidence interval
-compute ln(VACF); plot ln(VACF) vs time and a line of best fit; estimate persistence time parameter P with confidence interval
-plot histogram of speed distribution of all cell speeds at all times; overlay Maxwell-Boltzmann density function
-compute MSD; plot this with line of best fit and model predicted MSD
-plot speed distribution 'snapshots' at a chosen time point less than max(T)
 
3. Use file 'indivspeeds.m' to recreate figure 1 of the Supplementary Information.
