3D in silico trajectory analysis

1. Use file 'PRW3Dsim.m' to generate in silico cell trajectories with specified parameter values. 
Specify S, P, dt and initial speed, positions and velocities along with number of cells and number of simulation
periods. Alternatively use one of the datasets provided.

2. Use file 'fullanalysis3D.m' to carry out analysis of the cell tracks as in Figure 6 of the paper. This file can:
-plot the RMSS time series; estimate average cell speed parameter S with confidence interval
-compute ln(VACF); plot ln(VACF) vs time and a line of best fit; estimate persistence time parameter P with confidence interval
-plot histogram of speed distribution of all cell speeds at all times; overlay Maxwell-Boltzmann density function
-compute MSD; plot this with line of best fit and model predicted MSD

3. Use file 'speedanalysis3D.m' to carry out analysis of speed at specific times as in Figure 2 of the paper. This file can
-plot the RMSS time series; estimate average cell speed parameter S with confidence interval
-plot trajectories
-plot speed distribution 'snapshots' at a chosen time point less than max(T)

4. Use file 'VACFanalysis3D.m' to carry out analysis on VACF and P estimates for 6 different datasets as in Figure 3 of the paper.
This file can:
-compute ln(VACF); plot ln(VACF) vs time and a line of best fit; estimate persistence time parameter P 
for 6 different datasets with confidence intervals
